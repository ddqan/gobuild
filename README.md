# What is this?
This is shell script file. When we want to build/install our golang code, just run this, it's easy to use and can see what we are missing

# How to use?

* Put this file (build.sh) into your GO code root folder
* Go to that folder
* Run ` ./build.sh `
* Done. Now you will see the successful message if your code is build/install ok

Example:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/godemo
./build.sh
```

# Cheers

I'll be happy if you like to use this, welcome any comment and contribute on it.
